# Number Guessing Game
## Guess the number (1 - 100) right within 10 tries. 
### **_Introduction_**
Simple number guessing game is normally on the list for beginners (together with BMI calcualtor or normal calculator), therefore I did not want to miss it. It is a good start to taste DOM manipulation and use it together with other functions in different cases.  

### **_Project itself_** 
There is a random number in the beginning what we need to find. You have 10 guess in all and after submitting one guess, a gudieline/help appears (smaller or greater is the number). 

### **_Update_**
The game was rewritten in Vue.js as a good practice for the basic concepts of Vue.

After learning tons form The Net Ninja Tutorial and making a small Reaction Timer Game, I really wanted to try to create something with Vue by myself. I found my old vanilla JS number guessing game and it was perfect to practice Vue.

 ### **_Used Technologies_**
 1. HTML
 2. CSS
 3. JavaScript
 4. Vue

**Aim of the Project**

The goal of this project was to get familiar with DOM and how to grab and manipulate different elements. 

**Challenges within the Project**

In general it was a pretty straight-forward project. It was exciting to put together event handling with if-else if function. It was also fun to add and remove classes to different cases. 

### **_Update_**
I managed to rewrite the game in Vue. I used 3 components - start, guess(game on), scene(game over). I used many of the v-directives like v-for, v-if and data binding, passing props etc. 

I am going to be honest.. It was really fun to make it and I am getting hang of Vue.

## **_What have I learned_**
DOM manipulation and Vue basics
