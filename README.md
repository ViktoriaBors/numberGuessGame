# Number Guessing Game
## Guess the number (1 - 100) right within 10 tries. 
### **_Introduction_**
Simple number guessing game is normally on the list for beginner (together with BMI calcualtor or normal calculator), therefore I did not want to miss it. It is a good start to taste DOM manipulation and use it together with other functions in different cases.  

### **_Project itself_** 
There is a random number in the beginning what we need to find. You have 10 guess in all and after submitting one guess, a gudieline/help appears (smaller or greater is the number). 

 ### **_Used Technologies_**
 1. HTML
 2. CSS
 3. JavaScript

**Aim of the Project**

The goal of this project was to get familiar with DOM and how to grab and manipulate different elements. 

**Challenges within the Project**

In general it was a pretty straight-forward project. It was exciting to put together eventhandling with if-else if function. It was also fun to add and remove classes to different cases. 
## **_What have I learned_**
