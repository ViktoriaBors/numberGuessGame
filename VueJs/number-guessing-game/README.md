# Number Guessing Game

## My first Vue game!


### Introduction

After learning tons form The Net Ninja Tutorial and making a small Reaction Timer Game, I really wanted to try to create something with Vue by myself. I found my old vanilla JS number guessing game and it was perfect to practice Vue.

## **Result**
I managed to rewrite the game in Vue. I used 3 components - start, guess(game on), scene(game over). I used many of the v-directives like v-for, v-if and data binding, passing props etc. 

I am going to be honest.. It was really fun to make it and I am getting hang of Vue.
